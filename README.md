## Features

- **Event Initialization**: Set up events with a specified number of tickets.
- **Concurrent Bookings**: Handle multiple ticket bookings simultaneously, ensuring users have a smooth experience.
- **Waiting List Management**: When tickets are sold out, users can easily join a waiting list to get notified when tickets become available.
- **Booking Cancellations**: Users can cancel their bookings, and those on the waiting list will automatically get the chance to purchase the newly available ticket.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect the API from abuse with rate limiting.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Every edge case is managed, ensuring clear and informative responses.
- **Swagger Documentation**: Easily explore and understand the API with automated documentation.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The backbone of the application, providing a non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
- **NestJS**: A powerful framework for building scalable server-side applications with a focus on modularity.
- **TypeORM**: For seamless database interactions and migrations.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust RDBMS for storing our order details.
- **Swagger**: For generating interactive API documentation.
- **Jest**: To ensure that our code is well-tested and reliable.
- **Rate-limiter-flexible**: For enforcing rate limits on our API endpoints.
- **Class-validator**: To validate user inputs efficiently.

## Getting Started

Let‚Äôs get this project up and running!

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/event-ticket-booking-system.git
   cd event-ticket-booking-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your database**:
   - Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running.
   - Create a new database and adjust the configuration in the `.env` file accordingly.

4. **Run the migrations**:
   ```bash
   npm run typeorm migration:run
   ```

5. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

6. **Explore the API**:
   - Head over to `http://localhost:3000/api` to check out the interactive Swagger documentation.

## API Endpoints

Here‚Äôs a quick rundown of the available endpoints:

### 1. Initialize Event

- **POST** `/initialize`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "eventId": "string",
    "totalTickets": "number"
  }
  ```
- **Purpose**: Kickstarts a new event with the specified number of tickets.

### 2. Book Ticket

- **POST** `/book`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "userId": "string",
    "eventId": "string"
  }
  ```
- **Purpose**: Allows a user to book a ticket. If tickets are sold out, they‚Äôre added to the waiting list.

### 3. Cancel Booking

- **POST** `/cancel`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "userId": "string",
    "eventId": "string"
  }
  ```
- **Purpose**: Cancels a user‚Äôs booking and assigns the ticket to the next person on the waiting list, if applicable.

### 4. Get Event Status

- **GET** `/status/:eventId`
- **Purpose**: Fetches the current status of the event, including available tickets and the count of people on the waiting list.

## Design Choices

- **Concurrency Handling**: I‚Äôve utilized optimistic locking and NestJS transactions to handle potential race conditions effectively. This ensures our ticket booking process is both reliable and efficient.
- **Data Management**: TypeORM has been my go-to for managing database interactions and schema migrations‚Äîmaking our lives easier when evolving the data model.
- **API Documentation**: Swagger is integrated to provide real-time documentation, making it easier for developers (and future me!) to understand how to interact with the API.
- **Rate Limiting**: I‚Äôve added a layer of protection against potential abuse by implementing rate limiting with the `rate-limiter-flexible` library.

## Testing

Testing is at the heart of this project. Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs structured:

- **Unit Tests**: Every core functionality has been meticulously tested.
- **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive coverage for all API endpoints‚Äîaiming for at least 80% coverage overall.
- **Run Tests**:
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```
